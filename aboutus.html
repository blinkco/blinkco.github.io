          <h3> ROOTS </h3>
          <p> To understand BLINK CO.'s origin story, one must understand the state of Asian Diaspora in the West in the late 2010s: Chans, Lus, and WMAFs are everywhere, praised by whities and absolved by Asians. In an act to fight for Pro-Asian stances, those who would eventually come to form BLINK CO. joined a Pro-Asian space called AIDS (Asian Incel Discord Server). </p><br>
          <h3> AIDS: THE LOST PARADISE </h3>
          <p> Some legends say that for a time, there was peace in the place called AIDS. Others say that the grounds had been cursed ever since its inception. Only one thing is clear: It was not long until the members who founded BLINK CO. were considered unwelcome. Accused of failing to call the authorities on pedophiles, loving the Goddess Jisoo too much, and other slanderous lies, the BLINKS slowly left AIDS after rounds of bullying and unfair persecution. </p>

          <h3> FOUNDING OF BLINK CO.</h3>
          <p> The creation of BLINK CO. was not based on any decisive event. If you were to ask any of the BLINKS when the group was formed, they would not know an exact dates. However, a BLINKS' Professor of History states that the original BLINKS were formed during a short period before the legendary AIDS'&nbsp;<i>FEEDBACK WARS</i>, (an event in which many BLINKS were murdered in cold blood). After this event, the deceased and wounded were transported to the realm of a BLACKPINK server by the graceful hand of the legendary Gnome.<br></p><br>
          <h3>ASCENT TO POWER, FIGHTING PEDOS &amp; LOSING IT ALL</h3>
          <p> Following many of the BLINKS' departure from AIDS, a group of BLINKS ran into a pedophile who quickly ran into a swath of wealth and social power in a realm called SAD (Subtle Asian Dipshits). Using their previous experience with destroying pedophiles to their advantage, the BLINKS destroyed the pedophile and took power of his clout. However, it was not long until the BLINKS were defeated by a band of prepubescent teenagers and street hookers.</p>
          <p> Back in the land of AIDS, several remaining BLINKS held power in the COURT OF AIDS as sleeper agents, on a mission to destroy yet another pedophile (what's up with all these pedophiles?). They ultimately succeeded... but at the cost of their lives.</p><br>
          <h3> BLINK CO. TODAY </h3>
          <p> Today, the BLINKS are ragged veterans who have mostly hung up their war attires. They spend most of their time cold-approaching, creating high-quality memes, or investing in BLINK CO.'s diverse collection of company divisions. The BLINKS have been successful in their endeavors; launching best-selling novels, opening a zoo, and having sex in closets.
